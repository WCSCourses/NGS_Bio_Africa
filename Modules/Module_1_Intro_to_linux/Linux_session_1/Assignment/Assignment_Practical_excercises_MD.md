4.	Create a directory Assignment under Session1 (remember Session1 is under /unix/practical/)
5.	Move to the directory you just created 
6.	Copy the file PccAS_v3.gff3 located under ~/course_data/rna_seq_pathogen/data to Assignment. Write 2 different possible commands to do this. 
7.	How can you check that the file has been properly copied? 
8.	What’s the size of the file PccAS_v3.gff3? Type both the command you used to get the information and the size

12.	Create a new file excluding all the gene features and name this file PccAS_v3_withoutgenes.gff3
13.	Rename the resulting file PccAS_v3_withoutgenes.gff3 to question_12_results.gff3

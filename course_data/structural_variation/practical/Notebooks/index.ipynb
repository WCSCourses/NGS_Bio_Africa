    "## Introduction\n",
    "Structural variants (SVs) are large genomic alterations of at least 50 bp or larger in size. There are several types of SVs, including deletions, duplications, insertions, inversions, and translocations which describe different combinations of DNA gains, losses, or rearrangements. Copy number variations (CNVs) are a particular subtype of SV mainly represented by deletions and duplications. SVs are typically described as single events, although more complex scenarios involving combinations of SV types exist."

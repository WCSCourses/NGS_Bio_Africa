    "The third mutation is a bit harder to spot, because it's bigger than the read length (so no single read will span it). Look first at the coverage track, and notice a sharp coverage drop between chr7:87,483,833 and chr7:87,484,169. That suggests that one of the two alleles have been deleted across that position. Notice also the soft-clipping of some reads \"entering\" chr7:87,483,833 from the left, and the same softclipping of reads entering chr7:87,484,169 from the right. This soft-clipping shows up as reads being partly multi-coloured. That's happening because the physical genome between those points has been excised for one allele, causing the mis-alignment when we attempt to align some reads to the reference genome. That mis-alignment causes the bwa aligner to \"give up\" and mark a part of the read as soft-clipped.\n",

    "This mouse was bred from a zygote which was mutagenised with Crispr-Cas9, targeted at the Tyr locus. You are watching the zygote DNA-repair machinery panicking and grabbing at straws when trying to repair double-stranded DNA breaks. In the process, it makes mistakes, and those mistakes are propagated into the mouse genome: different zygote cells received different mutations, which is why some reads reflect different mutations to others.\n",

    "The CRISPR-Cas9 has acted on the zygote at this locus to create Non-Homologous-End-Join-based damage around 87,483,960: that resulted in a subclonal 1bp insertion and a 28bp deletion. Also, a related DNA repair process has resulted in the a 336bp deletion across the same area."

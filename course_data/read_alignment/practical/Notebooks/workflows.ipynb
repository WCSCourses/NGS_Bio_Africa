    "# NGS Workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical NGS experiment involves more than one sample, potential 10's or 100's of samples. During the experiment, a sample may be split across multiple libraries and and a library may be split across multiple sequencing runs (lanes). For example, you may have to increase the number of runs for a specific sample to increase the read-depth (sequencing volume), so you have to prepare multiple libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore you need a coordinated workflow, driven by standard software to bring it reliably together. Read alignment is just the first part of that. Once you have a BAM file for each sequencing run you need to merge them together to produce a BAM file for the library. At this stage it is important to perform de-duplication on the merged data. The main purpose of removing duplicates is to mitigate the effects of PCR amplification bias introduced during library construction. PCR duplicates erroneously inflate the coverage and, if not removed, can give the illusion of high confidence when it is not really there which can have an effect on downstream analysis such as variant calling.\n",

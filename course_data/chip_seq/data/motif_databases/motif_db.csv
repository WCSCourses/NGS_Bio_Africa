FLY/OnTheFly_2014_Drosophila.meme,no,yes,yes,OnTheFly_2014,The <a href="http://bhapp.c2b2.columbia.edu/OnTheFly/index.php">OnTheFly</a> database is a systematic collection of Drosophila melanogaster transcription factors and their DNA-binding sites. We annotated and classified all Transcription Factors (TFs) predicted in the Drosophila melanogaster genome and collected the known preferred DNA binding sites of the TFs based on the B1H&#44; DNaseI and SELEX experimental methods. OnTheFly houses DNA recognition motifs for 387 different genes encoding TFs (>50% of the Drosophila melanogaster genes encoding TFs). Reference: "OnTheFly: a database of Drosophila melanogaster transcription factors and their binding sites" (NAR <b>42</b>:D167-171).

HUMAN/HOCOMOCOv9.meme,no,yes,yes,HOCOMOCO (v9),The <a href="http://autosome.ru/HOCOMOCO/index.php">HOCOMOCO v9 Human</a> database contains a curated set of 426 non-redundant <i>homo sapiens</i> regulatory motifs for 401 TFs. DNA sequences of TF binding regions obtained by both pregenomic and high-throughput methods were collected from existing databases and other public data. The <a href="http://autosome.ru/ChIPMunk">ChIPMunk</a> software was used to construct positional weight matrices. Four motif discovery strategies were tested based on different motif shape priors including flat and periodic priors associated with DNA helix pitch. A quality rating was manually assigned to each model based on known binding preferences. An appropriate TFBS model was selected for each TF&#44; with similar models selected for related TFs. In any case only one model per TF was selected unless there was additional evidence for two distinct binding models or different stable modes of dimerization. All TFBS models and initial binding segments data used for motif discovery were mapped to UniPROT IDs.

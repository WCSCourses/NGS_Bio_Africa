    "\n",
    "Remember, the first value of the AD tag is the number of reference reads, the second is the number of alternate reads, therefore you will need to query the second value of the AD tag. The first value can be queried as AD[0] and the second as AD[1] (the allele indexes are zero-based).  In case of FORMAT fields, also the queried sample must be selected as  AD[sample:subfield] . Therefore add to the expression the condition AD[0:1] >= 25 to select the first (and in our case the only one) sample or  AD[*:1] >= 25 to select any sample for which the condition is valid.\n",

    "Now we can filter our callset. In order to evaluate the quality, we will use bcftools stats to calculate the ratio of transitions vs transversions. We start by checking what is the ts/tv of the raw unfiltered callset. The `stats` command produces a text output, we extract the field of interest as follows:"

    "# NGS Data formats and QC\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "There are several file formats for storing Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) data. In this tutorial we will look at some of the most common formats for storing NGS reads and variant data. We will cover the following formats:\n",
    "\n",
    "__FASTQ__ - This format stores unaligned read sequences with base qualities  \n",
    "__SAM/BAM__ - This format stores unaligned or aligned reads (text and binary formats)  \n",
    "__CRAM__ - This format is similar to BAM but has better compression than BAM  \n",
    "__VCF/BCF__ - Flexible variant call format for storing SNPs, indels, structural variations (text and binary formats)  \n",
    "\n",
    "Following this, we will work through some examples of converting between the different formats.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Further to understanding the different file formats, it is important to remember that all sequencing platforms have technical limitations that can introduce biases in your sequencing data. Because of this it is very important to check the quality of the data before starting any analysis, whether you are planning to use something you have sequenced yourself or publicly available data. In the latter part of this tutorial we will describe how to perform a QC assessment for your NGS data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning outcomes\n",
    "On completion of the tutorial, you can expect to be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Describe the different NGS data formats available (FASTQ, SAM/BAM, CRAM, VCF/BCF)\n",
    "* Perform a QC assessment of high throughput sequence data\n",
    "* Perform conversions between the different data formats\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tutorial sections\n",
    "This tutorial comprises the following sections:   \n",
    " 1. [Data formats](formats.ipynb)     \n",
    " 2. [QC assessment](assessment.ipynb)    \n",

    "## Authors\n",
    "This tutorial was written by [Jacqui Keane](https://github.com/jacquikeane) and [Sara Sjunnebo](https://github.com/ssjunnebo) based on material from [Petr Danecek](https://github.com/pd3) and [Thomas Keane](https://github.com/tk2).\n",

    "## Running the commands from this tutorial\n",
    "You can follow this tutorial by typing all the commands you see into a terminal window. This is similar to the \"Command Prompt\" window on MS Windows systems, which allows the user to type DOS commands to manage files.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get started, open a new terminal on your computer and type the command below:"

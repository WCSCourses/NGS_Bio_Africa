    "Many genomes contain large numbers of repeat sequences. Often these repeats are thousands of nucleotides long, and some occur in many different locations in the genome. This makes genome assembly a very difficult computational problem to solve. However, there are many genome assembly tools that exist that can produce long contiguous sequences (contigs) from sequencing reads. The assembly tool that you use will be determined by different factors, largely this will be the length of the sequencing reads and the sequencing technology used to produce the reads.\n",

    "In this practical we will assemble one chromosome of a malaria parasite: Plasmodium falciparum, the IT clone. We have sequenced the genome with both PacBio and Illumina and pre-filtered the reads to select only those reads from a single chromosome.\n",

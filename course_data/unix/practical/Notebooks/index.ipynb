    "# Unix for Bioinformatics\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Unix is the standard operating system on most large computer systems in scientific research, in the same way that Microsoft Windows is the dominant operating system on desktop PCs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unix and MS Windows both perform the important job of managing the computer's hardware (screen, keyboard, mouse, hard disks, network connections, etc...) on your behalf. They also provide you with tools to manage your files and to run application software. They both offer a graphical user interface (desktop). These desktop interfaces look different between the operating systems, use different names for things (e.g. directory versus folder) and have different images but they mostly offer the same functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unix is a powerful, secure, robust and stable operating system which allows dozens of people to run programs on the same computer at the same time. This is why it is the preferred operating system for large-scale scientific computing. It runs on all kinds of machines, from mobile phones (Android), desktop PCs... to supercomputers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Unix?\n",
    "\n",
    "Increasingly, the output of biological research exists as in silico data, usually in the form of large text files. Unix is particularly suitable for working with such files and has several powerful and flexible commands that can be used to process and analyse this data. One advantage of learning Unix is that many of the commands can be combined in an almost unlimited fashion. So if you can learn just six Unix commands, you will be able to do a lot more than just six things.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unix contains hundreds of commands, but to conduct your analysis you will probably only need 10 or so to achieve most of what you want to do. In this tutorial we will introduce you to some basic Unix commands followed by some more advanced commands and provide examples of how they can be used in bioinformatics analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning outcomes\n",
    "This tutorial consists of two sections, **Introduction to UNIX** and **Advanced UNIX for Bioinformatics**. By the end of the first section you can expect to be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Describe why UNIX is sutable for analysing NGS data\n",
    "* Know what the UNIX command line is\n",
    "* Understand the UNIX directory structure and navigate around this structure\n",
    "* Manipulate (move, copy and delete ) files using the command line \n",
    "* Look at and sort the contents of a file\n",
    "* Find the unique items in a list\n",
    "* Use the man command to find out more information about UNIX commands\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of the second section you can expect to be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Extract information from large files\n",
    "* Use regular expressions to search for particular patterns in a file\n",
    "* Use the AWK programming language to extract and filter information from a file\n",
    "* Create a bash script to perform several tasks at once\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sections of the Unix tutorial\n",
    "**Introduction to UNIX** comprises the following sections: \n",
    "  1. [Basic unix](basic.ipynb)   \n",
    "  2. [Files](files.ipynb)   \n",
    "\n",
    "**Advanced UNIX for Bioinformatics** comprises the following sections:\n",
    "  3. [grep](grep.ipynb)   \n",
    "  4. [awk](awk.ipynb)\n",
    "  5. [Bash scripts](bash_scripts.ipynb)\n",
    "  6. [Advanced bash](advanced_bash.ipynb)   \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** We do not expect you to get through all the material in the time allocated and a good target to aim for is the end of section 3 ([grep](grep.ipynb)). The remaining sections are optional and are for students who would like to expand their UNIX skills and can be completed outside the course hours.\n",
